Weather data sensors don't necessarily need to be complex, they can simply be observing the current temperature or humidity at a given location on the earth. All of it is valuable and is the \"truth\" that goes into the weather models for predicting future conditions. Sensors are rigorously tested prior to operational use and are continuously validated to ensure the data is accurate. \n",

    "They have many sensors onboard their platform that observe radiation signatures to determine what they are seeing. Each satellite has a different set of sensors that observe radiation at different wavelengths. When various wavelengths are used in conjunction, it allows us to determine what is happening at the surface of the earth or throughout the atmosphere that the radiation is travelling through. \n",

    "\n",
    "![Satellite orbit](img/satellite_orbit.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Polar orbiters are a little more complicated to work with because their field of view changes constantly and they only pass over the same location on the earth a few times per day. In order to get a global picture, you need to stitch together quite a few passes of the satellite through time. A big benefit though is that their data is very high resolution since they are much closer to the Earth's surface. These satellites are great for needing to see fine details of the Earth's surface. \n",

    "![Radar fundamentals](img/radar2.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few reasons that radar ground stations still exists and haven't been replaced by satellite observation of storms. \n",
    "1. **They can determine precipitation type.** Geostationary satellites have mostly passive sensors (meaning that they don't emit a pulse) since the Earth is so far away. These passive observations aren't able to tell you what type of particle exists in a given cloud. There are various types of precipitation and hail that can produce drastically different forecasts, and knowing the composition of a cloud is very important for that. \n",
    "2. **Quick updates of small-scale phenomenon.** Storms move across distances fairly quickly and the close polar-orbiting satellites that could use active sensors don't view the same spot for enough time to determine storm trajectory."

    "## Forecast Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The other main type of weather data is forecast data (ie. model data). As a **complete over-generalization, the Earth's weather changes based on fluid dynamics**. The atmosphere is made up of moisture particles that travel through various gases and aerosols that exist in the air. Those water droplets are then impacted by all sorts of forces: gravity, temperature disparities on the earth's surface, the spin of the planet, and about a dozen other factors. \n",

    "\n",
    "Many government agencies have their own weather models (sets of algorithms) used to predict the weather. As you can imagine, doing these calculations for the trajectories of water particles over the entire globe is complex and intense. Some models require **supercomputers to complete a model run and will produce petabytes of data per day**. Unfortunately for the data handlers (us), this insane amount of data is also **quite perishable** which means that those petabytes of data don't stay relevant. The data keeps changing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each day, most agencies run their model every 6 hours. This cadence was probably chosen because it was the fastest that the computers could generate a full suite of data that predicts 10 days of weather. \n",

    "Weather models produce data in 5 dimensions: \n",
